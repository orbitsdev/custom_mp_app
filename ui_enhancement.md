📄 UI Improvement Request Report

Project: Grocery / Food Delivery Mobile App
Module: Home Page – Product & Category Display
Requested by: [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]

1. Overview

I would like to request refinement and enhancement of the Home Page UI design.
The current layout displays categories and products, but the structure is visually unbalanced and does not follow modern UX/UI patterns seen in leading food delivery and grocery apps. These adjustments aim to improve clarity, hierarchy, and overall user experience.

2. Issues Identified in Current Layout
2.1 Visual Hierarchy Problems

Categories and products appear too close, making the content feel crowded.

No separation between sections (e.g., Best Sellers, New Items, All Products).

Products appear immediately without context or grouping.

2.2 Card Design Weaknesses

Product cards look flat and lack modern styling.

Images are inconsistent in size and aspect ratio.

No visual emphasis on “Featured” or “Best Seller” items.

Price styling is too plain.

2.3 Overall Layout Flow

The UI currently jumps from category icons → product grid without space or headings.

The user cannot distinguish product groups, making the browsing experience harder.

Missing banner or hero section that most modern apps use to guide users.

3. Requested UI Adjustments
3.1 Add Sectioning / Grouping

Please adjust the home page structure into clear, labeled sections like this:

Search Bar

Promo Banner / Hero Section (optional but recommended)

Category Chips (horizontal scroll)

Best Sellers Section

Fresh Fruits Section (horizontal scroll)

Fresh Vegetables Section (horizontal scroll)

Featured Products Section

All Products (grid)

This grouping gives the UI a professional, modern structure.

3.2 Improve Product Card Design

Please apply the following improvements:

Rounded image corners

Larger product images

More consistent image aspect ratio

Add floating “+” add-to-cart button in the upper-right

Use a shadow or subtle elevation

Improve text hierarchy

Product name: semi-bold

Category: lighter gray

Price: bigger and bold

3.3 Improve Category Section

Increase spacing between category images

Make category cards uniform in height

Ensure icons and labels are centered and consistent

Add padding under labels

3.4 Add More Modern Spacing & Rhythm

Add vertical padding between sections (16–24 px)

Add section titles (e.g., “Best Sellers”, “Fresh Fruits”)

Use clean 2-column grid with even spacing (12–16 px gap)

4. Visual Reference for Developer

Use modern food/grocery UI patterns for consistency:

Food delivery app card layout

Horizontal scroll product lists

Sectioned design (Best Sellers, Featured, etc.)

5. Expected Outcome

After implementation, the Home Page should:

Look visually clean

Have clear content grouping

Feel modern and professional

Improve user interaction and scanning

Increase product visibility and engagement
